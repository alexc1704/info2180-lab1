        <p> My name is Alex Campbell and i was born at the University of the West Indies Hospital. My initial interests before university were Biology, Phsyics and Chemisty but i decided to switch to Information Technology. I play a variety of sports which includes: Football, Tennis, Swimming, Pickleball, Basketball and Table Tennis. My least favorite course at the University right now is Net-Centric Computing. I am interested in Web Development as there is high job availabilty as clients will constantly want to push their products online.
